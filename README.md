The following programs are used to determine the amount of goals a particular NHL will have
depending on the two teams playing and if the game is home or away. This is done with linear regression
based on the data of previous games. Specifically, it assumes that the average shots allowed per games played
for all teams is correlated to how difficult it is to take a shot on those teams. The program then finds a correlation
between the amount of shots the inputted team took vs the opponent team's "difficulty" for all previous games of the season.

Shots per game can be very important when determining the outcome of a game.
This program does not take into account penalties yet.
